# tinyscalop

The repository was originally forked from **https://github.com/jlaffy/scalop**. 
The original repository contained code for scoring neoplastic cell states in both single cell and bulk, glioblastoma tumours samples, and also additional code for things like differential expression analysis and clustering described in the following paper: 

**Neftel et.al (2019) - An Integrative Model of Cellular States, Plasticity, and Genetics for Glioblastoma**

Because I was only interested in the scoring the neoplastic cell states and also did not want the pain of building complied code this is why this repo exists.
