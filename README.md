# Tiny scalop
A stripped down version of the Neftel et.al 2019, single cell analysis code.

The repository is a forked repository containing only the code relevant, to scoring single cells used in the analysis of:

**Neftel et.al (2019) - An Integrative Model of Cellular States, Plasticity, and Genetics for Glioblastoma**


The code for cell-state scoring and cell-state assignment is used in other repositories.
