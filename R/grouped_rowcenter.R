#' @description  Centers a matrix's rows by subsets of columns
#' @param m a matrix
#' @param groups list of character vectors specifying the column ids to center by.  Default: split_by_sample_names(colnames(m))
#' @param by how centering should be performed. One of 'mean' or 'median'. Default: 'mean' 
#' @return A row-centered matrix, centered within groups and with the order of cells within groups retained. The matrix has the same number of rows as <m> and as many columns as there are cell ids in groups.
